title: "Weeb Detector"

Weeb Detector was a prank I made to use on my brother, since he started watching anime. He deserved this punishment fully. I made a video on how to set it up and a code walk-through aswell. Here is an excerpt from "Catching Up & Centralizing" on future plans: 

*"Although just a one-off thing, I may add more prank features or make it Linux/MacOS compatible. It did help me get more familiar with networking in Java."*
